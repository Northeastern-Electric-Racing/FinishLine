You can setup the testing environment by running yarn test:setup. Then you can run yarn test as many times as you wish. Once done you may run yarn test:teardown to shutdown the testing environment and be able to use the normal dev environment again.\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Tests that force all exceptions to occur\n- [ ] Test that successfully invokes the function for the expected output.\n\n### Proposed Solution\nLook at how unmocked tests are currently used. You may want to look at test.utils.ts to see how we create test projects and setup organizations.',
